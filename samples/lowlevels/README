Examples in this directory use the 'lowlevel' interface of OBus. This
means that they create and send themselves their message. You must
know a minimum DBus to use it.

Note: you can control verbosity of OBus with the environment variables
OBUSLOG and OBUSDEBUG (see obus/log.ml for description). For examples
to see all errors returned by dbus applications set OBUSLOG to
"connection".
